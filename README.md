Datacamp course https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/time-series-with-python.

_Time series data is one of the most common data types and understanding how to work with it is a critical data science skill if you want
to make predictions and report on trends. In this track, you'll learn how to manipulate time series data using pandas, 
work with statistical libraries including NumPy and statsmodels to analyze data, 
and develop your visualization skills using Matplotlib, SciPy, and seaborn. 
You'll then apply your time series skills using real-world data, including financial stock data, 
UFO sightings, CO2 levels in Maui, monthly candy production in the US, and heartbeat sounds. 
By the end of this track, you'll know how to forecast the future using ARIMA class models_.


## Training Chapters
This training consists of the following chapters:
1. __Manipulating Time Series Data in Python__: _In this course we'll learn the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. We'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. We'll also learn how resample time series to change the frequency. This course will also show us how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, we'll use all your new skills to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data._
1. __Time Series Analysis in Python__: _From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce us to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, we'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, we'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. We'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance._
